        Forms are used for submitting data from a user to the server.
        The "action" attribute determines which page the data will be sent to.
        The "method" attribute determines whether the data will be stored in the URL or sent securely.
          -The "GET" method will store the data in the URL, meaning if the URL is sent to somebody, they will have the
          same exact page, as their URL will sent the same data to the server as the original request.
          -The "POST" method will submit the data behind the scenes, so if the URL is copied, none of the data
          will be included.
      -->
      <form action="contact.html" method="GET">
        <!-- 
          The label element is used kind of like a prompt for a form element. 
          The "for" attribute will tie the prompt to a form element by its ID.
        -->
        <label for="name">Please enter your name:</label>
        <!--
          The input element is used for several types of form fields including:
            -Basic one line text ("text")
            -Checkboxes ("checkbox")
            -Radio buttons ("radio")
            -Submit button ("submit")
          The type of element rendered is determined by the "type" attribute.
          The "id" attribute is used to globally identify an element on a page (for CSS / JS) as well as tie it to a label.
          The "name" attribute is used to determine what the field's data will be referred to when it is submitted to the server.
        -->
        <input id="name" name="name" type="text">

        <!-- The br (break) element is used to create a line break, but it's usually better to do this with CSS once you know how. -->
        <br />

        <!-- Type of "password" is the same as "text" but it will star out the content. This will NOT hide the content in form submissions. -->
        <label for="password">Please enter your password:</label>
        <input id="password" name="password" type="password">

        <br />

        <!-- I've labeled this section with a paragraph because there is no singular element to tie a label to. -->
        <p>Please select your relation:</p>
        <!--
          Radio button "groups" are determined by the "name" attribute. You cannot have multiple radio buttons selected within a group.
          The "value" attribute will determine what data is sent under the "name" when the form is submitted.
          Without a "value" attribute, it will send the data 'on'.
          The "id" attribute here functions similarly to above, uniquely identifying one specific element.
          By marking one radio button as "checked" we ensure that the form cannot be submitted (without HTML editting) with no button selected.

        <input id="coworker" name="relation" value="coworker" type="radio">
        <label for="coworker">Co-Worker</label>

        <!-- 
          Checkboxes are like radio buttons, except you can have multiple - or no - options selected.
          Aside from that difference, the structure of the element is very similar, with the attributes serving
          the same purposes.

        <!-- 
          Selects (drop-down lists) serve a somewhat similar function to radio buttons, but conserve space for larger lists.
          They allow you to select one option from a list.
          The value of the selected option will be passed under the "name" attribute of the parent select.
